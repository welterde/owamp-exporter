# define measurement targets
# SYNTAX: TARGET <name> <hostname> [options]
# Options:
# - local
#   The local host (do not specifiy testhost in powstream invocation)
# - shortname=<shortname>
#   Override the default shortname to be used in returned metrics
TARGET tgt1 destination_host local
TARGET tgt2 destination_host2
TARGET tgt3_6 2001:db8::1 shortname=tgt3
TARGET tgt3_4 192.0.2.1 shortname=tgt3


# configure default options for measurements
DEFAULT-PPS 10

# configure prometheus histogram (needs be fixed across time)
# these options are not used in VictoriaMetrics histogram mode
# (as it allows dynamic histograms)
#
# The histogram is defined in two regions:
# linear region from min_latency to max_linear_latency with N points per ms
# logarithmic region from max_linear_latency to max_latency with M points
#
# Anything below min_latency falls into the min_latency bin
# Anything above max_latency falls into the +Inf bin
DEFAULT-HIST min-latency 1 # ms
DEFAULT-HIST max-linear-latency 50 # ms
DEFAULT-HIST linear-points-per-ms 4
DEFAULT-HIST max-latency 1000 # ms
DEFAULT-HIST log-points 20

# define measurements between target1 and target2
# target1 is sender
# target2 is receiver
# SYNTAX: MEASUREMENT <name1> <name2> [options in key=value syntax]
# Options:
# - pps=<packets per second>
#   Number of packets to send per second
# - bucketwidth=<histogram width in seconds>
#   Size of each histogram bin in seconds to use in the backend (has no influence on resulting
#   prometheus or VictoriaMetrics histogram)
# - hist-min-latency=<minimum latency bin in milliseconds>
#   Minimum latency bin for prometheus histogram
# - hist-max-linear-latency=<maximum linear latency bin in milliseconds>
#   Maximum latency bin in the linear region for prometheus histogram
MEASUREMENT tgt1 tgt2
MEASUREMENT tgt2 tgt1 pps=5 bucketwidth=0.0001
